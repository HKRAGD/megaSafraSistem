Excellent analysis! Now I need your critical evaluation and final technical recommendation. Based on the current MERN stack system and the comprehensive analysis provided, please:

1. **Evaluate the technical merit** of the suggested approaches - which are most valuable and which have limitations?

2. **Consider constraints** - how well do the suggestions fit with existing codebase patterns, performance requirements, and the FSM (Finite State Machine) architecture already in place?

3. **Identify risks** - what are the hidden complexities, edge cases, or potential failure modes we should be aware of?

4. **Provide your final recommendation** - synthesize the best approach, considering:
   - Incremental implementation strategy
   - Minimal disruption to existing functionality
   - Performance optimization
   - User experience improvements
   - Code maintainability

5. **Go deeper** - explore additional considerations beyond the basic requirements that could provide significant value to users.

Remember, this is a production system with existing users, so stability and incremental improvement are crucial.
